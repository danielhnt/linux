Notify users on system related issues

/etc/issue and /etc/issue.net

issue and issue.net

/etc/issue is a text file whicj contains a message
or system identification to be printed before the
login prompt. It way contain varios @char and
/char sequences, if supported by getty-type 
program employed on the system.

/etc/issue.net is the historical location for pre-
loggin banners for network logins using protocols like
telnet or rlogin, but can be used for ssh
(escaped characters are not processed).

IMPORTANT
To add a message for remote logins, the banner 
path in /etc/ssh/sshd_config must be updated 
and the sshd service must be restarted.

/etc/motd

The contents of /etc/motd are displayed after a successful login
before the login shell is executed. The abbreviation "motd" stands for 
"message of the day", and this file has been traditionally used for exactly
that (it requires much less disk space than mail to all users)
