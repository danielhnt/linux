#Configure Your System to Use Your Network's DNS
#Modify the system's default connection to use the network's DNS server:
sudo nmcli con mod "System ens5" ipv4.dns "10.0.0.2"

#Verify the settings using the nmcli command and then checking the /etc/resolv.conf file:
nmcli -f ipv4.dns con show "System ens5"
cat /etc/resolv.conf

#We need to reactivate the system's network connection for the change to take effect:
sudo nmcli con up "System ens5"

#Verify our settings once more:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

#Now, attempt to resolve a hostname to an IP address:
host www.google.com
