#Adding a New Hard Disk to a Linux System
#Linux system administrators need to know how to add a new disk drive to a system, create a file system on that drive, and have it permanently mounted in /etc/fstab file. 
#This lab will assist in the practice of creating a new filesystem, mounting the filesystem to a directory, and then configuring the system so the mount persists across reboots.
#Create a New Partition
#Before we go mounting any new partition up, we've got to create that partition.
#Open up a terminal window and log in using the credentials provided on the lab page, replacing x.x.x.x with the public IP address listed:
$ ssh cloud_user@x.x.x.x

#Enter the provided password when prompted.
#Next, let's run the lsblk command to verify we have a /dev/nvme1n1 device available. Once we've confirmed that, we'll create a partition on the /dev/nvme1n1 disk using fdisk. 
#Note that we'll need to preface these commands with sudo for these commands. This partition we create will span the entire disk:
[cloud_user@host]$ lsblk
[cloud_user@host]$ sudo fdisk /dev/nvme1n1

#After running fdisk, we'll have to perform a few tasks. At the Command (m for help): command, type n to make a new partition, then hit Enter. 
#Our Partition type will be p, primary. Press Enter for Partition number, the First sector, and the Last sector options. This will make fdisk ready to create the partition. 
#Type p at the Command (m for help): to print out what the disk will look like after we commit our changes. If that all looks good, type w and press Enter to write 
#our changes to disk.
#Create the Filesystem
#Next, we've got to create a filesystem, so we can read and write data. We'll format the partition to the XFS file system with the mkfs.xfs command. Once that is complete, we'll run blkid on the newly created partition to obtain the UUID. We'll have to make a note of this UUID, since we're going to need it later:
[cloud_user@host]$ sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme1n1p1
[cloud_user@host]$ sudo blkid /dev/nvme1n1p1

#Mount the New Filesystem and Make It Permanent
#We can mount this partition up manually with the mount command, but it won't be a persistent mount; it won't get mounted after something like a reboot.
#We're going to edit /etc/fstab and create a new entry for the new disk at the bottom.
sudo vi /etc/fstab

#When you want to add text: hit the esc key and then i to go into insert mode type as normal.
#When you want to save: hit the esc key and then :wq!
#You may find the following vim cheat sheet helpful as well: https://linuxacademy.com/site-content/uploads/2019/05/vim-1.png
#The format should follow the following (be sure to use your disk's UUID from the previous step):
UUID=YOURUUID /opt xfs defaults 0 0

#We can save the file (:wq!), Then run:
[cloud_user@host]$ sudo mount -a

#This will mount everything that's listed in fstab, including our new partition.
#And running a quick df -h /opt should show us roughly 5GB available for the /opt directory.
